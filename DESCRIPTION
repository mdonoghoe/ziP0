Title: Provides a Joint Binomial-Poisson Family for mgcv
Description: A small package that provides a joint binomial-Poisson
    family that can be used with mgcv. Appropriate for cases when an outcome 
    can be a fixed zero, and (unlike zero-inflated Poisson) these observations
    can be identified separately from zero counts.
